# Project Name
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
> they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

> You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
